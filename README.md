## Obsidian Export

[Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) is great but lacks support for many of the plugins we Obsidian addicts have grown accustomed to â€” in particular [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), but also [Citations](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin), [Admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition), and more.

This plugin lets you export your `md` notes to `html` static files for self-hosting. It supports a bunch of popular plugins.

---

## Reference

- As with Obsidian Publish, you just need to include a `published: true` field in your metadata for a note to be included in the export.
- You can add a `slug: "some-slug"` or `slug: ["one", "of", "several", "slugs"]` to specify the slug of the file produced. Otherwise it's just the `kebab-case` of your note name.
- By default, links to unpublished notes will be removed. However, you can include an `external` field in an unpublished note's metadata. Then, the link will be transformed to point to the value of `external`.

```markdown
%% "My Random Note" %%
---
published: true slug: "custom-slug"  
external: https://www.random.org/
---

- If `published` is true, this file will be included in the export. Just like Obsidian Publish.
- If `slug` is not explicitly provided, it defaults to `my-random-note`.
	- If you provide multiple slugs, e.g., `["custom-slug-1", "custom-slug-2"]`, then the note will be exported to a file whose name is the first provided slug. Eventually, I'd like to add support for redirecting additional slugs to the first.
- If `published` is `false`, links to this note will be replaced with `https://www.random.org/`

```

## How it works

This plugin uses [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) under the hood to do the converting. It uses a set of plugins to recreate "Obsidian-flavored markdown":

- [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)
- [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter)
- [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math)
- [remark-mermaidjs](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mermaidjs)
- [remark-numbered-footnote-labels](https://github.com/jackfletch/remark-numbered-footnote-labels)
- [remark-wiki-link](https://github.com/landakram/remark-wiki-link)
- [remark-cite](https://github.com/benrbray/remark-cite)

Plus a few new modifications to do things like comments and embed wikilinks `![[]]`. Eventually, I'll probably publish this as a new remark plugin (so you can access Obsidian-flavored markdown in other projects). Conversely, I'll add support for arbitrary remark plugins, so you have even more to choose from.
