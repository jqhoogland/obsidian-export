## Obsidian Export

[Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) is great but lacks support for many of the plugins we've grown dependent on â€” in particular [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), but also Citations, Admonition, and more.

This plugin lets you compile your `md` notes to `html` for self-hosting.

It uses [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) under the hood to do the converting, so, in the future, it'll be possible to use any remark plugins you'd like. For now, it uses a set of plugins that can interpret Obsidian-flavored markdown:

- [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)
- [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter)
- [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math)
- [remark-mermaidjs](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mermaidjs)
- [remark-numbered-footnote-labels](https://github.com/jackfletch/remark-numbered-footnote-labels)
- [remark-wiki-link](https://github.com/landakram/remark-wiki-link)
- [remark-cite](https://github.com/benrbray/remark-cite)

Plus a few new modifications to do things like comments and embed wikilinks `![[]]`.

## Reference

- As with Obsidian Publish, you just need to include a `published: true` field in your metadata for a note to be included in the export.
- You can add a `slug: "some-slug"` or `slug: ["one", "of", "several", "slugs"]` to specify the slug of the file produced. Otherwise it's just the `kebab-case` of your note name.
- By default, links to unpublished notes will be removed. However, you can include an `external` field in an unpublished note's metadata. Then, the link will be transformed to point to the value of `external`.
